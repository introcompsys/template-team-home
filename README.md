## In peer reviews 

Use the following as a template in your reviews. 

```
Is the contribution clear and concise? Identify any aspect of the writing that tripped you up as a reader.
Are the statements in the contribution verifiable (either testable or cited source)? If so, how do you know they are correct?
Does the contribution offer complete information? Does it rely on specific outside knowledge or could another CS student not taking our class understand it? 
Identify one strength in the contribution, and identify one aspect that could be strengthened further.
